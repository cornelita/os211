# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)

    The objectives of the process scheduling algorithm are to keep the CPU as busy as possible, fair allocation of CPU, max throughput, min turnaround time, min waiting time, and min response time. There are many CPU scheduling algorithms. You can read more on this article if you're curious about it!

2. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)

    When I got a question about preemptive scheduling on quiz week 8, I found this article. This article said, when a process switches from running state to ready state or from the waiting state to ready state, it uses preemptive scheduling. While, when a process terminates or a process switches from running to the waiting state, it uses non-preemptive scheduling.

3. [FCFS Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)

    FCFS stands for First Come First Serve. It is a scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the simplest form of a CPU Scheduling algorithm. This article also mentions the advantages and disadvantages of FCFS. Read more on this article.

4. [SJF Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)

    SJF stands for Shortest Job First. It is a scheduling algorithm that selects the waiting process with less execution time to execute next. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. Read more on this article if you're curious about it!

5. [Priority Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)

    Priority Scheduling is a scheduling algorithm that executes a process based on its priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority. It depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc. It is suitable for applications with fluctuating time and resource requirements.

6. [Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html)

    In Round Robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm offers starvation-free execution of processes.

7. [Multilevel Queues Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-queue-mlq-cpu-scheduling/)

    Multilevel Queues is a scheduling algorithm that separates the ready queue into various separate queues. In this method, processes are assigned to a queue based on a specific property of the process, like the process priority, size of the memory, etc. Every queue may have its separate scheduling algorithms.

8. [Multilevel Queues Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-feedback-queue-scheduling-mlfq-cpu-scheduling/)

    The difference between this algorithm and MLQ is the ability to move between the queues. Using this algorithm, we can move between the queues since it keeps analyzing the behavior of processes and according to which it changes its priority.

9. [Scheduling Algorithms -  Solved Problems](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk)

    After understanding each scheduling algorithms, I watch videos from Neso Academy. There are many problems discussed here. The explanation is clear and easy to understand. Watch this if you still need more insight on the scheduling algorithm.

10. [Set Scope of Thread Attributes Object](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_attr_setscope.3.html)

    The pthread_attr_setscope function sets the contention scope attribute of the thread attributes objects referred to by attr to the value specified in scope. It returns 0 on success and a nonzero number on error. Read more on this Linux manual page.
