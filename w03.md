# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Files & File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science](https://youtu.be/KN8YgJnShPM)

    This video explains basic information about files and file systems.  It also explains how computers can keep all data organized and readily accessible to users. Since reading the OSC are clear as mud, for me, this video is helpful.

2. [Linux File System Types](https://youtu.be/g7OkSvioFlU)

    As a novice user of Linux, the types of Linux file systems are confusing. That's why I need this kind of video that explains it clearly. Linux file systems consist of ext2, ext3, ext4, etc. Each of them has its characteristics.

3. [Linux: File Manager](https://youtu.be/DCp4h-GVsEo)

    One of the file attributes is protection. We protect a file by giving file permissions. It can be written in numeric value too. In Linux, we can change it using the chmod command.

4. [File System Mounting](https://youtu.be/A8ITr5ZpzvA)

    On Linux, we have to mount hard disk partitions before you can use them. It is pretty easy since this video explains it thoroughly and clearly. Thumbs up for The Linux Man!

5. [Demo: Mounting A File Systems](https://youtu.be/85dBD5M2i9U)

    Need more explanations in mounting? Check this out! The Linux Man give a demo on how to mount a file system.

6. [Demo: Managing Permissions](https://youtu.be/YbPOg2s3Hhc)

    The Linux Man show us a demo on how to use the chmod command to modify file permissions. The demo helps me understand how to manage permissions.

7. [MBR Disk Partitions](https://youtu.be/CfBMnb0jtp8)

    At first, I was guessing what was disk partitions? But this video explains it clearly. Although we didn't use it since we used a virtual box, we still need to know about it.

8. [Demo: Viewing Hardware Information](https://youtu.be/G07otC0ts1Q)

    The Linux Man show us a demo on how to view our hardware information in proc and sys directories. Like the other video, the explanations are clear and easy to understand.

9. [Free Space Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/free-space-management-in-operating-system/)

    The system maintains a free space list that tracks all free disk blocks. It can be implemented mainly as a bitmap, linked list, grouping, and counting. For more details, please read the article.

10. [Apple File System](https://youtu.be/9I7fg930Deg)

    After learning about the Linux file system, I'm curious about the other file system and found the APFS. This video from Computer Clan answers my curiosity about Apple File System.
