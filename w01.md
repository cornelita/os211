# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Markdown & HTML](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

    Want to build your website using markdown and style it using CSS? Check this website to get a complete list of how markdown syntax converted to HTML tags.

2. [Online Linux Terminal](https://cocalc.com/)

    Haven't installed and configured the Debian using Virtual box but want to try Linux command? Try it here!

3. [.bash_aliases? What For?](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/)

    A ".bash_aliases" file is a file that allows us to write command shortcuts. It saves us from having to remember and write long commands.

4. [What are Unix swap(.swp) files?](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2931534/what-are-unix-swap-swp-files.html)

    Every time you start an edit session using vim, the swap(.swp) file is created automatically and deleted(automatically as well) when you finish. It helps prevent us from losing the content of our files if some error occurs and from editing the same file at the same time.

5. [Regex by The Net Ninja](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD)

    Regex is confusing for me because I'm not used to it. This playlist from The Net Ninja helps me to get an understanding of it.

6. [Vim Cheat Sheet](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15131/f17/topics/vim/vim-cheatsheet.pdf)

    As a novice VIM user, I need a VIM command cheat sheet because I can't remember all the commands. Check this link to get the cheatsheet I'm using.

7. [Difference between Operating System & Kernel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-operating-system-and-kernel/)

    At first, I was still confused by the terms OS & kernel. This article (from geeksforgeeks) helps me gain a basic understanding of it.

8. [Kernel in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/)

    After understanding the difference between the OS & the kernel, I became more curious about the kernel because a system needs an OS and an OS needs a kernel to operate. This article explains it clearly.

9. [Java Virtual Machine](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/index.html)

    Java is a compiled and interpreted language. It means the program needs to be compiled and translated to machine language and then interpreted by JVM so the computer can run it. Read more about the process in chapter 18.7.2, it's really interesting!

10. [What is GNU/Linux?](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/ch01s02.en.html)

    In a GNU/Linux system, Linux is the kernel component then the rest of it consists of other programs, many of which were written by or for the GNU project. We prefer to use the term "GNU/Linux" to refer to systems that many people casually refer to as "Linux" because the Linux kernel alone does not form a working operating system.
