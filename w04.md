# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [First, Next, Best, And Worst Fit Allocation Strategy](https://youtu.be/N3rG_1CEQkQ)

    First Fit, the simplest, means it will search the first space that is big enough to accommodate the data. Although this video isn't in English, I can understand it since he uses illustration to explains it.

2. [Memory Management](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html)

    Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory. Its goal is to optimize the overall performance of the system by assigning blocks to various running programs. There are several memory management techniques, as you can see in the article. In my opinion, this website explains memory management clearly and thoroughly.

3. [Address Translation](https://youtu.be/ZjKS1IbiGDA)

    To translate virtual to a physical address, you need to know the rule and term first. Here, David gives a brief and clear explanation about it.

4. [Little Endian vs Big Endian](https://youtu.be/WBA6svOyWb8)

    Little-endian is an order in which the least significant value gets stored first. Big-endian is an order in which the most significant value gets stored first. Check this video if you are still confused about little-endian and big-endian.

5. [Linux Libray](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)

    A library is a collection of pre-compiled pieces of code called functions. A library is not executable. That's why it is different from processes and applications. If you are curious, you can check this article. It also explains the difference between the two kinds of the library.

6. [Paging in Operating Systems](https://youtu.be/pJ6qrCB8pDw)

    Paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory. It lets the program exceed the size of available physical memory.

7. [Malloc? Calloc? Realloc? Free?](https://youtu.be/lQP4X3odvHE)

    Well, all of that is a function in the C program. Its usage is to manage memory. Find out more in the video!

8. [Introduction to Pointers in C](https://youtu.be/f2i0CnUOniA)

    Pointers are important in the C program. It is capable of storing some addresses. More about it on the video!

9. [Declaring And Initializing Pointers in C](https://youtu.be/b3G9RjG4l2s)

    This video illustrates about declaration and initialization of pointers in C. It is very simple and easy to understand.

10. [Memory Swapping](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/what-is-memory-swapping/)

    Memory swapping is a computer technology that enables an operating system to provide more memory to a running application or process than is available in physical random access memory (RAM). It works by using virtual memory and storage space in an approach to provides additional resources when required.
